The company is UK based and it is a non-store online retailer. They sell mainly occasion gifts. Most of the customers are wholesalesrs who are both local and international. The transactions in this data set are between the date ranges of 12/1/2010 - 12/9/2011. This is a detailed exploratory data analysis on retail ecommerce store.

### Context from the data source on kaggle:
"Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail". "

## Where did the dataset come from?
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data



This EDA is conducted using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. After importing libraries and the data, I clean it and prepare it for analysis. I visualize sales data over time, product categories, and regions to start my exploration. Then I begin to answer specific business questions such as identifying the top selling products and regions, analyzing sales trends over time, and understanding the impact of promotions on sales. To conclude my analysis with some insights based on the plots I created.
> My notebook features how to create interactive visualizations using the plotly library.
