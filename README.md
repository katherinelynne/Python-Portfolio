# Project 1: Product and Retail Analytics- EDA

## What is the purpose of this project? 
The company is UK based and it is a non-store online retailer. They sell mainly occasion gifts. Most of the customers are wholesalesrs who are both local and international. The transactions in this data set are between the date ranges of 12/1/2010 - 12/9/2011. This is a detailed exploratory data analysis on retail ecommerce store.

### Context from the data source on kaggle:
"Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail". "

## Where did the dataset come from?
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data



This EDA is conducted using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. After importing libraries and the data, I clean it and prepare it for analysis. I visualize sales data over time, product categories, and regions to start my exploration. Then I begin to answer specific business questions such as identifying the top selling products and regions, analyzing sales trends over time, and understanding the impact of promotions on sales. To conclude my analysis with some insights based on the plots I created.






# Project 2: Marketing Analytics- What Drives Ad Performance?

## What is the purpose of this project? 
The purpose of this project is to see what drives Ad performace. Using predictive analytics to analyze a dataset of ad performance to make predictions about what factors drive engagement. I perform exploratory analysis then train regression models to make predictions and provide insight into what factors drive engagement for ads. Based on the coefficients of my regression model the factors that appear to have the strongest impact on engagement are the number of ad impressions and clicks, the ad category, the ad type, and the type of ad creative. 

Based on those factors, the conclusions I came to were to increase engagement, ad campaigns should focus on ad impressions, advertisers should consider using videos in their ads which also appear to generate higher engagement. Advertisers should consider their target audience when creating ads, as certain types of ads appear to generate higher engagement that others. Overall, the factors that drive engagement in my analysis could provide valuable insight for an advertiser to help them optimize their ad campaigns to generate higher engagement.
