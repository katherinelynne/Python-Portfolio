# Project 1: Product and Retail Analytics- EDA

## What is the purpose of this project? 
The company is UK based and it is a non-store online retailer. They sell mainly occasion gifts. Most of the customers are wholesalesrs who are both local and international. The transactions in this data set are between the date ranges of 12/1/2010 - 12/9/2011. This is a detailed exploratory data analysis on retail ecommerce store.

### Context from the data source on kaggle:
"Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail". "

## Where did the dataset come from?
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data



This EDA is conducted using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. After importing libraries and the data, I clean it and prepare it for analysis. I visualize sales data over time, product categories, and regions to start my exploration. Then I begin to answer specific business questions such as identifying the top selling products and regions, analyzing sales trends over time, and understanding the impact of promotions on sales. To conclude my analysis with some insights based on the plots I created.






# Project 2: Marketing Analytics- What Drives Ad Performance?

## What is the purpose of this project? 
The purpose of this project is to see what drives Ad performace. Using predictive analytics to analyze a dataset of ad performance to make predictions about what factors drive engagement. I perform exploratory analysis then train regression models to make predictions and provide insight into what factors drive engagement for ads. Based on the decision tree, there are 2 main outcomes, the rest didn't have much of an impact because of how I built the decision model. What determines the success of a future campaign or what drove the ad performance was 1. the outcome of the previous ad campaign and 2. the duration of the campaign itself.

Those are the 2 things that matter the most using this decision tree which was a 3 level tree.

Based on those factors, the conclusions I came to were to further analyze the previous as campaign and possibly revisit the decision tree to a 5 level treee to see if the outcomes change significantly. Perhaps it would be more informative to see if any other factors matter. Digging deeper to see if any more features are important. Also, duration of the ad campaign could be explored further to see if months long ad campaigns do better.
